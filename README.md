<h1>🎨 HandDraw: Real-Time Gesture-Based Drawing with AI 🖐️</h1>

<h2>📝 Project Description</h2>

<p><strong>HandDraw</strong> is a Python-based project that uses <strong>MediaPipe</strong> for hand landmarks detection and <strong>OpenCV</strong> for real-time drawing. The software captures hand gestures and visualizes them as drawings on the screen, offering an interactive and creative user experience. This project demonstrates the power of combining <strong>AI</strong> with real-time image processing to build innovative applications.</p>

<h2>🎥 Demo</h2>

<p><em>In the demo, you can see a real-time drawing of "I ❤️ U" using hand gestures.</em></p>

<h2>✨ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>⚡ Real-time hand landmarks detection</li>
  <li>✍️ Gesture-based drawing visualization</li>
  <li>🖥️ Easy to use interface</li>
  <li>🎯 High accuracy with <strong>MediaPipe</strong></li>
  <li>🎨 Customizable drawing colors and shapes</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚙️ Installation</h2>

<p>Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine.</p>

<h3>📦 Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then install the necessary libraries.</p>

<pre><code>pip install opencv-python mediapipe</code></pre>

<h3>🛠️ Cloning the Repository</h3>
<p>Clone the repository to your local machine:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandDraw.git
cd HandDraw</code></pre>

<h3>▶️ Running the Project</h3>
<p>Once installed, you can run the project by executing the Python script.</p>

<pre><code>python hand_love.py</code></pre>

<p>You will see a window pop up, and the camera will start capturing hand gestures in real-time, turning them into drawings.</p>

<h2>🚀 Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>📸 Make sure your camera is enabled and pointing toward your hand.</li>
  <li>🖍️ Use your index finger to choose a color on the screen.</li>
  <li>🖌️ Use your index finger and thumb to draw on the screen.</li>
  <li>🎉 Explore different gestures to create fun shapes and designs!</li>
</ol>

<h2>🧠 How it Works</h2>

<ul>
  <li>📷 <strong>MediaPipe</strong> detects hand landmarks in real-time from the camera input.</li>
  <li>🖼️ <strong>OpenCV</strong> processes these landmarks and converts them into drawing strokes on the screen.</li>
  <li>✋ The program allows users to draw by moving their hands, simulating pen-like behavior in the air.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔮 Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🧩 Adding more gesture types for different actions (e.g., undo, change color).</li>
  <li>🤚 Extending the project to recognize multiple hands and gestures simultaneously.</li>
  <li>🖥️ Enhancing the UI for a more interactive experience.</li>
</ul>
